### For myself

So, i am gonna use 'Tendoyo' as my nickname to record all my nagging things in my phd candidate period.
Maybe someday, when i come back to this place, i would be of no regret about my contribution, but most importantly, i don't want to have any pity.
Thus, man rush! Rush towards your goal and realize your value. When you come there, you
would be grateful to yourself.

### California Hotel
BTW, here is my most favourite song -- California Hotel
